I am currently a senior studying visual communication design at Eastern Washington University. I hope to eventually expand my skills to photography, web design, motion design, and UX design. I like to explore new places and food in my free time. 
I have always been interested in drawing and photography. I enjoy combining digital art and photography together. My goal is to create positive impact through design. I strive to make things that have meaning one way or another.  As a designer, I want to produce designs that are visually appealing, reusable and functional.<p>
